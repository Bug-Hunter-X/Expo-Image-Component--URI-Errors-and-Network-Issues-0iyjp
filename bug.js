This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  Here's a common scenario and how to debug it:

```javascript
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const imageUri = 'https://example.com/image.jpg'; // This might be wrong!

  return (
    <Image source={{ uri: imageUri }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
  );
};
```

**Problem:** The image at `https://example.com/image.jpg` might not exist, might be improperly served (incorrect headers, etc.), or the URL itself could contain typos. 

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Verify the URI:** Double-check the URL for typos.  Make sure it's the correct path to your image.
2. **Directly Access the URI:** Open the URL in your browser. If you get a 404 error or the image doesn't load, the problem is with the image source itself, not Expo.
3. **Check Network Requests:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the network request made by your app. Look for errors in the request.
4. **Temporary URI:** Try using a known good image URI (like a placeholder image) to see if the `Image` component works correctly. This isolates whether the issue is with the component or the URI.
5. **Check Permissions:** Ensure your app has the necessary permissions to access network resources if you're using a remote image.
6. **Image Cache:** Clear your device's image cache; sometimes old, corrupted cached images can cause issues. On Android, clearing cache and data for the app often helps.
7. **Proxy Issues:** If you're behind a proxy, ensure that your device or emulator is configured correctly to access external network resources.
8. **HTTPS:** If using a remote image, confirm it uses HTTPS and not HTTP.  Expo often requires HTTPS for security.
